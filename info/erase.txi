@pindex Erase
   ERASE erases the graphics screen. The macro @code{era} erases the
screen without appearing on the history buffer. If you want to start a
new output page on a hardcopy device use the PAGE command.

You may be able to erase individual lines with LTYPE ERASE, if you can
you should look at the macro @code{undo}.
