Syntax: RANGE number_x number_y
@end example

If number is non-zero, set the range on the x or y axis to be number,
so LIMITS will choose two values that differ by number. Nothing will
happen until you issue a LIMITS command.

For instance, if you wanted to ensure that the y axis of a logarithmic plot
spans exactly two decades the commands RANGE @code{0 2} LIMITS @code{x y } would
choose suitable y limits, with actual values appropriate for the @code{y}
vector (in fact symmetrical about the median value).
