Syntax: WRITE HISTORY WORD
or      WRITE STANDARD
or      WRITE [+] WORD

   WRITE HISTORY WORD writes the macro WORD onto the top of the history buffer.

   WRITE STANDARD writes a string to the standard output. The string
is taken to be the rest of the line up to a carriage return (which may
be written explicitly as \n). WRITE filename is similar, but it writes
the string to a file. If the filename is the same as the last time
that you used this command, or if you preface the filename with a `+',
the string is appended; otherwise the file is overwritten.

   For WRITE macro_name, see MACRO (or maybe SAVE).
